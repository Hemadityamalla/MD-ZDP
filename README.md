# MD-ZDP

- A simple code to perform 0D chemistry simulations occuring in electrical discharges.
- Some of the modules used in this code were taken from afivo-streamer (give the link)
- TODO: Improve the initial condition inputs. Right now, we can just specify the electron density and the first positive ion density.

#### How to run the code

- `make`
- `./zdPlasmaChem streamer_2d.cfg`
